:::caution
Discuss all dialysis or renal transplant patients with the Renal SpR (#45626).

Discuss unstable patients or those with multi-organ failure with senior and escalate as appropriate.

If hyperkalaemia is refractory to treatment or ECG changes persist, discuss with local ITU.
:::

## Treatment

Start with ABCDE assessment and identify risk factors for arrhythmia, including potentia rate of rise in serum potassium (e.g. rhabdomyolysis, tissue necrosis or oliguric renal failure). Perform 12-lead ECG if K ≥ 6.0.

### Protect the heart

If required, administer 30 mL calcium gluconate 10% neat over 5 minutes via a large peripheral vein with continuous cardiac monitoring.

If a large vein is unavailable, administer over 10 minutes and watch for extravasation. 

Administer over 30 minutes if there are concerns about digoxin toxicity.

:::info
30mL calcium gluconate is the dose recommended in the national guidance.

An alternative is 10mL 10% calcium chloride over 5 - 10 minutes.
:::

Repeat dose after 5 minutes if ECG changes persist. This can be repeated after 5 minutes. Effects are transient (30 - 60 minutes).

If extravasation occurs contact Plastics at RLH via switchboard.

:::caution
Do not administer sodium bicarbonate simultaneously via same access (risk of formation of insoluble calcium salts) or mix with any other drugs (risk of incompatibility).
:::

### Shift K+ into cells

Administer 8 units of Actrapid insulin in 100 mL of 20% glucose over 15 minutes. Effects peak at 30 - 60 minutes and last for up to 6 hours.

If 20% glucose is unavailable, administer 10 units of Actrapid insulin in 50 mL of 50% glucose. This can be given over 15 minutes but must be given via central venous access device as venous irritation and tissue damage may occur in cases of extravasation.

:::caution
Do not give glucose in DKA if CBG ≥ 20 mmol/L. Give insulin only. 
:::

Administer 10 - 20 mg of nebulised salbutamol (10 mg in patients with IHD, severe tachycardia). In combination with insulin-glucose, salbutamol can lower serum potassium by an additional 0.5 - 1.0 mmol/L. Effects last up to 2 hours. Nebulised salbutamol may not be effective, especially in patients taking beta-blockers or digoxin, and should only be used as first-line treatment while awaiting IV access for insulin-glucose.
