# LMWH

## Indications

- Thromboprophylaxis
- Prevention of clotting in the extracorporeal circuit during RRT
- Treatment of VTE, DVT or PE for:
    - Short term for new diagnosis (5 days LMWH -> dabigatran or edoxaban)
    - Long term for patients who are intolerant or have contraindications to oral anticoagulation
- ACS with additional requirement for anticoagulation (e.g. AF, VTE) or where CrCL < 20 mL/min
- AF when oral anticoagulation is contraindicated (off-label use)
- Mechanical valves when oral anticoagulation is contraindicated (off-label use)
- Superficial vein thrombosis when fondaparinux is contraindicated

## Thromboprophylaxis
### Enoxaparin dosing

Medical and surgical patients at high risk of VTE should receive enoxaparin as shown in the table below.

| Weight | Standard dose | Renal dose<br/>(CrCl 15 - 30) |
|---|---|---|
| < 50 kg | 20 mg OD | 20 mg OD |
| 50 to 100 kg | 40 mg OD | 20 mg OD | 
| > 100 to 150 kg | 40 mg BD | 40 mg OD |
| > 150 kg | 60 mg BD | 40 mg OD |


:::info
Patient with CrCl < 15 mL/min or on RRT should be assessed individually. If VTE prophylaxis is necessary, consider enoxaparin 20 mg OD (off-label use). Notify the renal team about these patients.
:::

:::info
For patients aged 16 - 17 years:

- On adult wards: enoxaparin as per adult dosing (off-label use)
- On paediatric wards: dalteparin 2500 - 5000 units OD
:::

### Extended thromboprophylaxis

#### Major intra-abdominal cancer surgery

Continue LMWH for 28 days postoperatively.

#### Elective hip/knee replacement

If DOAC is contraindicated, continue LMWH for 28 days after hip replacement and 14 days after knee replacement.

#### Fragility fractures of pelvis, hip, proximal femur

Continue LMWH for 28 days.

#### Lower limb immobilisation

Consider LMWH. Consider stopping prophylaxis if lower limb immobilisation continues beyond 42 days.

## Therapeutic anticoagulation

:::tip
Assess suitability for DOAC before considering therapeutic LMWH
:::

### Enoxaparin

Indicated if CrCl > 30 mL/min.

#### 1.5 mg/kg OD

Default treatment of VTE.

#### 1 mg/kg BD

- ACS with additional requirement for anticoagulation (e.g. AF, VTE)
- Treatment of VTE and one of the following:
    - Weight > 100 kg
    - Recurrence or extension of thrombosis despite once-daily LMWH
    - High risk of recurrence or extension (on discussion with Haematology, Cardiology or Vascular Surgery), e.g.
        - Metallic valves where warfarin is contraindicated
        - Large burden acute iliofemoral thrombosis
        - High risk PE by ESC criteria

#### 1 mg/kg OD

Treatment of ACS and CrCl ≤ 20 mL/min (if CrCl > 20 mL/min, first-line treatment is fondaparinux).

:::info
Refer to Cardiology and Cardiothoracics teams for dosing in AF and mechanical valves.
:::

### Special groups

#### Obese patients

Use actual body weight to calculate LMWH doses. Anti-Xa activity monitoring is advisable for patients weighing > 144 kg and receiving enoxaparin. 

#### Renal impairment

Tinzaparin is indicated if CrCl ≤ 30 mL/min or on dialysis, except in ACS (refer to section above on enoxaparin).

Tinzaparin treatment dosing in renal impairment is shown in the table below.

| CrCl | Tinzaparin dose | 
|---|---|
| 20 - 30 mL/min | 175 units/kg OD |
| < 20 mL/min | 125 units/kg OD<br/>Anti-Xa monitoring (discuss with Haematology) |

## Contraindications

:::caution
Discuss with Haematology regarding relative contraindications and alternatives in the presence of absolute contraindications.

## Regional anaesthesia

**Do not use regional anaesthesia until**

-  ≥ 12 hours after a prophylactic dose of LMWH, or
-  ≥ 24 hours after a therapeutic dose of LMWH

**Do not remove epidural catheters until**

-  ≥ 12 hours after a prophylactic dose of LMWH, or
-  ≥ 24 hours after a therapeutic dose of LMWH

**Wait  ≥ 4 hours before giving LMWH after**

- Removal of epidural catheters
- Insertion of spinal blocks
